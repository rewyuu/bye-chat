        <p>This is my final goodbye to everyone that's on this website. If you managed to get here, it means you are somewhat connected to me from the past, or you're my friend. If you're reading this, yes, I don't play or want to go online anymore.</p>
        
        <p>I have a lot of dreams and plans that I am pursuing in my life, and I really want to make sure they happen. My life is already a mess, and I'd like to make sure that my future relatives have a better life than mine.</p>
        
        <p>The past four years have been the best years of my life. I've been on Discord for a long time, and I'll also be selling my Roblox account: gargged. DM me on IG @rewyuu_ if you're interested. If you managed to read all this, I love you. You really are connected to me somehow.</p>

        <p>Even though, It is very unhealthy to be on your monitor 24/7, I really had a very fun year with everyone, I have met a lot of amazing people that that I would cherish their memories with.</p>
        
        <p>I love everyone I've made friends with, or even enemies in the past. These messages are for you to remember that all the hate I had before is already forgotten. I love you all, and thank you again.</p>
        
        <p>If I hurt you in the past and ghosted you, I'm very sorry. I wasn’t in the right mental state to make the best decisions. I hope you can forgive me for what I did.</p>
        
        <p>To everyone who knew about my past, I've really changed this past year. I didn’t like the person I was before, and I don’t want to go back to that.</p>

        <p>I have told the whole truth of what I wanted to say, I always lied to people and asked them to forgive me, Maybe if I had been open with everyone from the start and told the truth, Then I wouldn't have leave them this message as a failure of what I have become</p>

        <p>I might have asked a lot of times to be forgiven but you really dont have to forgive me If i did something bad from you before. Just know that I have hated myself back then as I am writing this now.</p>
        
        <p>Sorry everyone, There won't be next time, This is all of it of what I can say. I hope that all of you achieve what you really wanted to be in your life, Please dont go the same way that I went to. I would want you to forget about my existence as I really dont deserve anyone, I would always be unloveable in and out and that is fine with me.</p>

        <p>I'll be active on GitHub and IG. As for my IRL friends and family, I'll be pursuing my programming career. Thank you again, and this is my final goodbye.</p>
